/** This class provides core functionality for interacting with Spotify. You must have a valid, logged-in
 SPSession object before using any other part of the API.
 
 To log in and use CocoaLibSpotify, you need two things:
 
 - An application key, available at the [Spotify Developer Site](http://developer.spotify.com/).
 - A user account with the Premium subscription level.

 Please note that CocoaLibSpotify does _not_ push audio data to the system's audio

 as you see fit. See the SimplePlayback sample project for an example of how to do this.

 to libSpotify and is separate from the application's main queue (`dispatch_get_main_queue()`).

 for new audio.
